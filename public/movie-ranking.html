 <h4 style="color: aliceblue;">Last Seen Alive</h4>
 <p>I found this movie to be reasonably gripping and interesting </p>
 <h4 style="color: azure;" >Blink Twice</h4>
 <p>Blink Twice is the first film Iâ€™ve seen that includes a trigger warning before it starts</p>
 <h3 style="color: aliceblue;">2073</h3>
 <p>This is not a fictional Sci-fi film, its a Documentary framed as a Sci-fi film <br>
    And it's non-fictional in most parts. <br>
    Its real its factual and well researched with everything that is going on in the world today.</p>
